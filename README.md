Effects of Climate Change on Residential and Commercial Heating Oil Consumption: A Study Applied to New York State:

Problem Statement:
1) The energy system needs improvement to interface with different climate scenarios with accurate model interpretations
2) Predicting climate change constitutes a difficult scientific challenge surrounded by intrinsic uncertainty and assessing the economic and social consequence of climate change is an equally complicated exercise.
3) Refiners may delay producing heating oil for winter if consumer demand is high for a seasonal product like gasoline. This results in low Heating oil consumption at the beginning of heating season(winter).
4) New York accounts for 80% of US households that use heating oil for space heating.

Data Sources:
1) The climate change data for New York State for the time period 2000-2018 were extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA).
2) The residential and commercial heating oil consumption data was extracted from the government website of US Energy Information Administration.

Methodologies:
1) Multiple linear regression
2) Ridge
3) Lasso
4) GAM
5) MARS
6) Bagging
7) Random Forests
8) Bagging
